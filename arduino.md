## General Workshop Flow
- What is arduino
- How does it work
-
- Goal should be to make the light game that they made last year at cuhackit

### What is an arduino?
- It is an open source microcontroller
- #### Well what the heck is a microcontroller?
  - small computer on a single integrated circuit
  - Typically has:
      - Memory
      - Input / Output circuits

### How does it work?
- Runs a 'startup' function when it turns on
- After the initial function it will run code on a loop for as long as it is powered
  - this loop can have whatever logic you want on it! ***subject to memory constraints***

### Why is it useful?
- A full on computer (or raspberry pi) is overkill for a lot of applications
- Can make a lot of useful decisions without a lot of memory consumption
